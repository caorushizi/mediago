pnpm types:renderer
```

## Architecture

The frontend is designed to work in two contexts:
1. **Electron Renderer**: Loaded in Electron's BrowserWindow
2. **Standalone Web**: Served by the webapi backend for browser access

It communicates with the backend services through Socket.io for real-time updates and HTTP APIs for data operations.
